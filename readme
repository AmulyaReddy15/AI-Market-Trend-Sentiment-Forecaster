Step 1: Data Cleaning (cleaning.py)
Cleans raw data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and normalizing text to ensure high-quality input for analysis.

Step 2: Data Merging
Combines Amazon and Flipkart datasets into a unified structure to enable cross-platform comparison and analysis.

Step 3: Data Reduction
Reduces dataset size after merging by filtering redundant or less relevant records, improving efficiency and performance.

Step 4: Categorization (category.py)
Defines and assigns meaningful categories to the data, enabling structured and category-wise analysis.

Step 5: Sentiment Analysis (sentiment.py)
Applies sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral) to textual data and assigns dates for temporal sentiment tracking.

Step 6: Topic Modeling
Identifies key discussion themes and hidden patterns in the data to understand what consumers are talking about.

AI Analysis & RAG Integration :
The project uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to combine semantic search with AI-based reasoning.
Relevant documents are retrieved using embeddings, and AI models generate context-aware insights, summaries, and trend explanations.

API Integration :
news_api.py – Fetches market-related news articles
reddit.py – Collects consumer discussions and opinions
rapid.py – Retrieves additional consumer data via Rapid API

These sources enrich the dataset and improve sentiment and trend accuracy.
